# My Learning Journey : project -1

Welcome — this repository documents my journey from zero toward full‑stack web development. I store exercises, small projects, notes, and larger apps here. 
## A candid note
This is my very first website and the code is basic and raw. Expect irregular layout, simple markup, and frequent changes. This repository is meant to show progress, not perfection.

## What’s in this folder
- `index.html` — first static landing page
- `style.css` — styles used on the page
- `image.png`, `image1.jpeg` — image assets

## How to preview locally
- Quick: open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Recommended (local server, PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
